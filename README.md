# Description
This code repository is the official implementation of the paper "DCC: Dynamic Category Compression for Enhanced Handwritten Text Generation".

# Instruction
Our proposed method is generic and effective, and theoretically can be seamlessly integrated into existing HTG methods.

For the relevant code, please check the network section of the corresponding method on your own.
